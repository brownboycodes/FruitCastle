## HOW TO LOGIN?

To login to a HADWIN account users will need to provide an username or email address and the password associated with that account.

Since no database is connected to the backend servers the feature of truly creating new accounts and using them to login is unavailable. The current HADWIN app can be described as the demo version/prototype of what the actual product might be/behave like. 

The required details of all the available accounts to login to are listed below :-

## HOW TO ADD CARDS?

The current HADWIN can be described as the demo version/prototype of what the actual product might be/behave like. Therefore, there isn't any database connected to the backend servers, as a result the feature of truly adding new cards and saving that information on the server securedly is unavailable. However, the card details will be saved locally of the device of the user.

To add a card `go to the "My Wallet" screen` and `tap on the "ADD CARD +" `that appears on the screen above the list of available cards. Any card that is added will be saved in the sate of the app and will disappear if the app is restarted.

The add card feature can process any card with 16 digit card numbers due to unavailability of better designs **the feature is programmed to only recognize cards belonging to American Express, VISA, Discover and MasterCard**. For the safety of the user it is recommended to test this feature with the test data provided
