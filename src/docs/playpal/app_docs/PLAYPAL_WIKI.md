## HOW TO ADD CARDS?

Since there isn't any database connected to the backend servers the feature of truly adding new cards and saving that information on the server securedly is unavailable. The current PlayPal can be described as the demo version/prototype of what the actual product might be/behave like.

To add a card go to the "My Wallet" screen and tap on the "ADD CARD +" that appears on the screen above the list of available cards. Any card that is added will be saved in the sate of the app and will disappear if the app is restarted.

Although the add card feature will process any card (can process upto 16 digit card numbers), for the safety of the user it is recommended to test this feature with the test data provided
